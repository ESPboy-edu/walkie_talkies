walkie_talkies
====

Send and receive sound between Particle Photons, using microphones and speakers from Adafruit!  Easy and fun, 1 day build or faster.



Hardware
====

Checkout the hardware folder for a bill of materials and a fritzing diagram


Software
====

Checkout the firmware folder for a simple app that will broadcast audio as basic UDP packets to your Wi-Fi network.  The
code also listens for packets from other similar devices and automatically plays the audio it receives!


Thanks!

Enjoy!
