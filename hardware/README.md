    - powerful little low power microcontroller, super easy to make a connected thing

- Small speaker ($2)

    - a 3w 4ohm speaker should be plenty loud for this!  We'll use a small amp to power it

    - so you can be loud!

    - push to talk!  fits in a breadboard!

  Depending on what you have laying around, retail you can build a pair of these for less than $70.  Not bad for a
  high quality, fully customizable toy / tool that works anywhere your Wi-Fi works.  And with some small software 
  changes, can work anywhere in the world...  So not bad for a simple VOIP phone with zero subscription costs!
